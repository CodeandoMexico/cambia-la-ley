## About pull requests
  We are in a process of improvement, we are adding tests with Mocha and Should.js. Although we still don't have a well defined test framework we encourage every pull-request to have tests. Every pull-request must:
  - Reference an issue in the commit message. Example of a commit message: [#23] Improves performance of database.
  - Give a clear explanation of why that pull-request exist. The explanation must take place in the github pull-request's comment section.

  The core-team is committed to answer every pull-request within 3 business days with at least a follow-up comment.
